My name is Justin Jang, a sophomore at Duke University studying Electrical and Computer Engineering as well as Computer Science. I was born in Southern California, and I became interested in this field because I was really interested in the applications of integrating software, something that I have used in the past, with hardware in order to provide tangible impact to those around me. I can't wait to learn and contribute to this project!
