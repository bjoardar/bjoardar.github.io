My name is Eduardo Ortega, and I am a current a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a concentration in Hardware Security at Duke University. My research focuses on the intersection of fault-tolerant hardware design, emerging computational technology, and cryptographic primitives. I bring 2 years of software and test engineering experience and am also an Alfred P. Sloan 2021-2022 Scholar. I received my Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts in Integrated Engineering, concentration Embedded Software, with minors in Mathematics and Leadership Studies from the University of San Diego. My undergraduate work allowed to be listed as a co-author for a publication and place 3rd in an international case study competition. Eduardo is passionate about bridging industry and academic efforts for collaborative research and outreach.
